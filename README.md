# StreamTracker
Simple Html/JavaScript Stream Tracker

### What is this?
Here is the reason why: [Reddit: List of pro players that are livestreaming now](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4d1nyb/list_of_pro_players_that_are_livestreaming_now/)

tldr: an up-to-date list of current professional league of legends players streaming **now** live.

### Why?
i hacked some fast js/html code together, but people asked me to open source it, so they can participate.


### Where?
changes will be uploaded and can be seen on the [project site](http://novocalculus.com/streams/)

### Things that could be done:
- code cleanup (i'm a javascript newb, more experienced with C++/Java/Python/... )
- add more streaming websites
- css enhancements for mobile experience (but should be clean, small, functional)
- removing tables in favour of divs
- adding features, e.g. if player x streams, check riot api for current champ and display it (and so on)
